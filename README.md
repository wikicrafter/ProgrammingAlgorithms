# ProgrammingAlgorithms
In this repository I'm gonna share my learned skills about programming foundation 

* Before using this repository you gonna have basic understanding about programming. Like: how to use functions, declaring variables etc.

You should be familiar with using text editor to write and debug code. It doesn't matter which editor you would like to use.
I recommend to use VSCode it's free, opensource and doing his job.

In this repository we gonna use  Python language.

Okay, I think prerequisite is enough now let's talk about algorithms:

---

# Common Algorithms

* Searching Algorithms <\n>
We use that to find specific data in a structure
 
* Sorting Algorithms <\n>
That one is used to take a dataset and apply a sort order to it

* Computetional Algorithms 

Given one set of data, calculate another

* Collection algorithms

Work with collections of data 

Bellow will be shown algorithm basics:

* [Euclid's Algorithm](gcd.py)
