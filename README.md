# ProgrammingAlgorithms
In this repository I'm gonna share my learned skills about programming foundation 

* Before using this repository you gonna have basic understanding about programming. Like: how to use functions, declaring variables etc.

You should be familiar with using text editor to write and debug code. It doesn't matter which editor you would like to use.
I recommend to use VSCode it's free, opensource and doing its job.

In this repository we gonna use  Python language.

Okay, I think prerequisite is enough now let's talk about algorithms:

# Common Algorithms

* Searching Algorithms <br>
We use that to find specific data in a structure
 
* Sorting Algorithms <br>
That one is used to take a dataset and apply a sort order to it

* Computetional Algorithms <br>
Given one set of data, calculate another

* Collection algorithms <br>
Work with collections of data 

# To work with algorithms you must to know whcih data structures to use. For instance:
1. Arrays
2. Linked List
3. Trees
4. Stack and queues
5. Hash tables

Bellow will be shown algorithm basics:

* [Euclid's Algorithm](gcd.py)

* [Hashtable](hashtable.py)

* [Linkedlist](linklist.py)

* [Queue](queue.py)

* [Stack](stacl.py)

* [Recursion](recursion.py)

* [Countdown](cuountdown.py)







Data structures: <br>

Arrays : Collection of elements identified by index or key <br>

Linked Lists: Collection of data elements, called nodes <br>

Stack: Stack is a collection which supports push and pop operations <br>

Queues: collection that supports adding and removing <br>

Hash(or we can call a dictionary) tables: is a data structure in which the address or the index value of the data element is generated from a hash function <br>

Recursion:  [Recursion](recursion.py) is when function calls itself <br>





Data sorting: <br>
* [The Bubble Sort](bubblesort.py)
* [The Merge Sort](mergesort.py)
* [The Quick Sort](quicksort.py)

Searching data: <br>

* [Issorted](issorted.py)
* [Unordered](unordered.py)
* [Ordered](ordered.py)

Other algorithms: <br>
* [Filter](Filter.py)
* [Findmax](findmax.py)
* [Value Counter](ValueCounter.py)
